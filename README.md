Command line App to sort / search out various loads of data

<h1> Algorithm Runner </h1>
<span><b> Test how long various sizes of data take to be sorted by an array of algorithms on your machine </b></span>
<br>
<br>
<span>The time an algorithm takes to run is <strong>NOT</strong> The same for every machine which is why we use big O notiation </span>
<span>This program will measure the start and end time of each sort and print out how long YOUR machine took<span>
